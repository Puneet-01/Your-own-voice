                <h4>IPL 2021, DC vs PBKS (KXIP) Highlights: Dhawan 92 powers Delhi Capitals to six-wicket win over hapless Punjab</h4>
                <p>Delhi Capitals has just strolled through a 195-run chase with sheer nonchalance at the Wankhede in a Super Sunday finish. The big hits were surely on the cards and Punjab got it right at the start with Mayank Agarwal and KL Rahul, albeit at a lower strike-rate, led Punjab to a decent yet just barely-par 195/4 on this wicket.

                    Delhi had to have a strong start if they were to trounce a Punjab bowling line-up that had enough firepower to defend the total. However, a Dhawan masterclass single-handedly took the game away from them - a blistering 92 off 49 balls - pushed the Punjab bowlers down the barrel.
                    
                    This will be a hard pill to swallow for skipper Rahul on his birthday as his fine set of bowlers have all taken a pounding tonight.</p>
                <p>Shikhar Dhawan (Player of the match): It was a conscious effort from my side (to increase SR) and I started taking more risks. I'm not afraid of changes. I'm always open towards changes and I make sure I give it a good try in the nets and then in the games. I'm not scared of getting out as well. I've worked on the leg-side shots, coming in the crease, using the pace of the bowler. Depends who's bowling and what plans I make for them. My slog shot has improved. It was there before as well, but now it's [more frequent]. I'm very relaxed these days. If I'm not relaxed at this time, then when?! I'm relaxed but also attentive. Love batting with Shaw, we made a huge impact and that was great for our team.

                    Rishabh Pant (winning captain): I've already started enjoying the captaincy but we were under pressure at the start because the wicket was not doing much and they had a good start. Good job by our bowlers to keep them to 190. There are many things you can talk to with Shikhar but end of the day what he's given to the team is commendable. I like to keep the environment light so that people enjoy their cricket and make the most of their opportunities.
                    
                    Stoinis: (jokes) At the 10-over mark we were trying to keep them under 250. [It's about] the cliches of cricket, the good partnerships to leave it for the finishers at the end. Shikhar's brilliant, he's carried on his form from last year. He's always hungry and he's backed it up from last season. It's important as an individual to get into the tournament early. The start of the tournament is when you can try a few things. As of eight games in, every game feels like it's a final. So we think by 5-6-7 games we need to have everyting sorted. [With his bowling] wasn't required tonight but it is a work in progress and we'll all be required.
                    
                    KL Rahul (losing captain): Victory would've been sweet on my birthday. Slightly disappointing but we've still got a lot of games left. In the end when you look at it, it does looke 10-15 short. But I felt batting in the middle 196 was really good. The first half Mayank and I were saying the same, that we'd be good if we got 180-190. But obviously at Wankhede there's dew and credit to Dhawan. Dew did sway things, bowling second's always a challenge at Wankhede. We always try to prepare for such conditions but it does get difficult in the situations. I think it would be fair [the ball changes every two overs, Doull's suggestions] and I'm not just saying that because I'm on the losing side. I did ask the umpires to change the ball a couple of times but that's not in the rules.</p>
